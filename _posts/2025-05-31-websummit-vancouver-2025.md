Last week was something special. I had the chance to attend WebSummit Vancouver 2025, the first time this global tech conference has ever come to our city. For me, it wasn’t just an event—it was a signal that Vancouver’s tech scene is evolving, and the future is bright for those of us who care about diversity, inclusion, and innovation.

From the moment I arrived, the energy was contagious. This was a truly global gathering, with startups and tech leaders from all over the world, and a refreshing level of representation—especially for Black and Indigenous communities. All three of the pitch finalists were women, which is something I rarely see at tech conferences. Watching them present, I felt a sense of belonging and possibility that I haven’t experienced before.

The conference itself was impressive: four days packed with high-level presentations, networking, and inspiration. I even ran into my neighbor—proof that WebSummit brought together not just the global tech community, but our local one too. But my real mission was to connect with as many Black organizations and individuals as possible.

I was fortunate to receive a free ticket through the Federation of Black Canadians, as part of the Black Innovation Zone (BIZ). BIZ is a coalition of about eight Black tech organizations, including Ethos Lab and the BC Community Alliance, who worked together to ensure nearly 200 Black tech founders, investors, and attendees could access the conference. Their presence and collaboration made a huge impact.

One of my favorite parts was the event hosted by BIZ at Ethos Lab’s space in Vancouver on the first night of the conference. It was a warm, welcoming networking opportunity where we got to see a screening of their new documentary about their youth-oriented programs and space. The sense of community was immediate, and it set the tone for the rest of my WebSummit experience.

At the actual conference, BIZ had a dedicated space on the floor—complete with a stage and seating—where they hosted pitch sessions, open mic events, and more. The lightning-round open mic was a highlight for me. I even got lucky in a raffle, winning a free t-shirt and, more importantly, the chance to introduce and promote Rize Digital to a room full of brilliant, like-minded people—for free!

The past few years have brought a lot of change for me. Moving to Canada, navigating the tech industry, and finding my footing in both the Black community and the broader tech world haven’t always been easy. But being surrounded by so many inspiring Black professionals at WebSummit reminded me why I do what I do. It revitalized my passion and gave me a clear sense of purpose. I know now, more than ever, that the work I’m doing with Rize Digital matters—and that I have a place and a path forward.

A huge thank you to the Federation of Black Canadians, BC Community Alliance, Ethos Lab, and everyone involved in the Black Innovation Zone coalition. Thanks to their hard work, nearly 200 of us had access to this incredible experience. This conference wasn’t just a milestone for Vancouver’s tech scene—it was the beginning of something much bigger. I left WebSummit inspired, connected, and ready to rise.

Social Media Summary

WebSummit Vancouver 2025 was a milestone for our city’s tech community. Over four days, I connected with startups and leaders from around the world and was inspired by the strong representation of Black and Indigenous tech innovators. The energy was electric, the presentations were top-notch, and it was amazing to see all three pitch finalists as women—a rare and encouraging sight in the tech world.

A special highlight was the Black Innovation Zone, organized by a coalition of eight Black tech organizations, including Ethos Lab and the BC Community Alliance. Thanks to the support of the Federation of Black Canadians, nearly 200 Black tech founders and professionals had access to the conference. The BIZ events—from a networking night at Ethos Lab to pitch sessions and open mics at the conference—created a powerful sense of community. I’m grateful for everyone who made this experience possible, and I know this is just the start of something incredible for Vancouver’s tech scene.
