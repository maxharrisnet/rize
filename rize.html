        <h2>Your Digital Partner</h2>
        <p>Iâ€™m Max Harris â€” a web developer, educator, and community-minded technologist based in Vancouver. After more than a decade working in fast-paced startups and marketing teams, I made a conscious decision: to use my skills to serve the communities that matter most to me.</p>
        <p>Thatâ€™s what Rize Digital is all about.</p>
        <p>As a Black technologist with deep ties to Indigenous communities through my family, I understand that access to digital tools and knowledge isnâ€™t equal â€” but it should be. Iâ€™ve taught web development to learners from all walks of life, built accessible websites for nonprofits, and helped entrepreneurs bring their ideas online with confidence.</p>
        <p>Now, Iâ€™m bringing that experience to Rize Digital â€” to support small businesses, non-profits, and community organizations through thoughtful web development, culturally-informed digital strategy, and hands-on education.
          Whether you need a website, a workshop, or a roadmap for digital transformation, Iâ€™m here to build with you â€” not just for you.
          Letâ€™s rise together.
